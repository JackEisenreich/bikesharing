**Bike Sharing Challenge**

**Overview of the analysis**

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze bike trip and subscriber/customer data across different demographics to determine the viability of launching a ride sharing program in Des Moines

**Results:**

**Trips Length & Gender**

Most Trips that were taken were very short. Most less than 20 minutes,

Analyzing this by gender yields the same resuls. Most rides are short regardless of what gender someone identifies as.

Most rides in general were taken by men. This explains why the concentration of short rides was higher for them.

**Trips by time of day and day of week:**

Most rides were taken during rush hour. 8am was the peak time in the morning and 5pm was the peak time in the evening.

This heat map furthers that point. The most concentrated amount of rides are in those same slots. On the weeknds you can see that durng those same periods there are not as many rides being taken.

This seems to be true regardless of gender. Most rides during the week are taken during ruh hour and on weekends the rides are more spread out throughout the day.

In general most rides are taken by male subscribers on weekdays.


**Summary**

**High level:**

In general, most rides are taken by males during weekdays during rush hours. This may be because men like using the bike sharing to get to and from work more than women. The most amount of rides occur in the evening. This could possibly be because people are using the rides not only to get home from work, but also to travel to other places and to use for exercise in general. Trips on weekends occur more throughout the day; probably because people's weekends are generally less structured. If there is a large work population of working men in Des Moines this could be a very successful venture.

**Additional Analysis:**

If it were to conduct more analysis, I would first look at the start sation locations by time. I could create a heat map of where these rides are starting so I can identify that people are mainly going to concentrated business areas in the morning and leaving from concentrated business areas in the afternoon. This could confirm or refute whether business travel is the main use of the bikes.

Another visualization I would look at would be a heat map trips per weekday per hour by birth year. I would like to see if there is an overcoentration of young people using the bikes to get to and from school on weekdays.
